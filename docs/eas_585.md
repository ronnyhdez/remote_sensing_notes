## A review of remote sensing

## Sensor classification

There is a classification based on energy resources and wavelength region.

**Energy resources** : 
 - Passive sensors: This ones just measure reflectance
 - Active sensors: They emit a beam of light and measure houw much returned back. 

**Wavelength region**: 
 - Visible / reflectie infrared
 - Thermal infrared
 - Microwave

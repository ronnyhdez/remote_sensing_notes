## A review of remote sensing

## Sensor classification

There is a classification based on energy resources and wavelength region.

**Energy resources** : 
 
 - Passive sensors: This ones just measure reflectance. 
 Some examples are NOAA, Sentinel 1.
 Negative side is that clouds can interfere with the methodology and measurements.

 - Active sensors: They emit a beam of light and measure houw much returned back.
 Some examples are Lidar, radarsat.

**Wavelength region**: 
 
 - Visible / reflectie infrared
 - Thermal infrared
 - Microwave

## Spatial resolution

Active and passive sensors have different spatial resolution. Spatial resolution is about how clear can you see the ground,or the object in the image.

An important concept is the **pure pixel**

A pure pixel can be a pixel that is composed almost everything by just one component, for example, a pixel that shows just a forest or just an urban area. This pure pixels are the ones that can tell to a computer the main characteristics of the object represented in there.

There is a phenomena that occurs with the pixel classification. This is because, given that the pure pixel can be a little bit combined (its classified as a forest but it has a small portion of urban area) we are going to have some bias in the classification. Although this approximation to the problem works. Nonetheles, there are other methodologies to create better classifications such as **pixel breakdown**.

## Temporal resolution

This is the amount of pictures in time that we can obtain from a certain place. The need for a bigger or a smaller scale of temporal resolution it's going to depend on the study. For example, agricultural landscapes will need a bigger temporal resolution (be able to detect changes in short periods of time) given that the changes in the landscape over time are very common. On the other side, geological studies commonly don't  need to have a detailed temporal resolution becauses changes are not that common. 

> On slide 7 in Lecture 1 there is graphic showing the relation between spatial and temporal resolution.

## Radiometric resolution

This is the sensitivity of a sensor, i.e. it's ability to measure and to enable distinction from the same spectral band of differences in the electromagnetic energy reflected by the elementary ground surfaces. 

For example, if we have an image with just 4 grey levels, the ability to distinguish between the objects in the surface is not much, but if the same image has 256 grey levels, objects in surface are better defined.

## Spectral resolution

The spectral response  which characterize the reflectance and/or emittance of a feature or target over a variety of wavelengths allows to distinguish between different classes or features and details in an image. The ability of a sensor to define fine wavelengths intervals is the spectral resolution. 

Different sensors have different abilities to define the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

This electromagnetic spectrum have known segments as for example the visible spectrum that goes from 400 to 700 nm in wavelength (0.4 um - 0.7 u). The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers from from 1mm to 750 nm and can be divided in 3 parts:
 
 - Near infrared 2500 - 750 nm
 - Mid-infrared 10 - 2.5 um
 - Far infrared 1mm - 10 um

> On slide 10 in Lecture 1 there is an image of the electromagnetic spectrum. We can see that more wavelength less frequency.

## Spectral reflectance 

The spectral reflectance results from the presence or absence, as well as the position and shape of specific absorption features of the surface. With the sprectral reflectance, we can obtain the spectral signature of different elements in a surface, for example, soil, vegetation, minerals among others. 

When we have a figure with spectral signatures, we need to understand that when in the y-axis (reflectance) there is a decrease in the curve, its because of the aborbance of radiation. High points in the curve means that there is no absorption of radiation. Different elements will have different signatures and thats, in general terms, we can have an idea of the composition of the elements in a surface.

Another phenomena occurs when there is presence of water, given that this element have low levels (almost al the curve near 0) 

## Multispectral

Remote sensing systems can record energy over separate  wavelength ranges at various spectral resolutionsThis is over a variety of different wavelength ranges. Usually they scan 7 bands.

## Hyperspectral

Systems that are more advance than multispectral ones, can record **more that 7 bands**. So this systems have the capacity to detect hundreds of very narrow spectral bands throughout the visible, near-infrared and mid-infreared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum

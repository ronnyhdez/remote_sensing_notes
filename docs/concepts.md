# Keywords in remote sensing

 - **BRF**: Vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor. Describe the surface reflective properties in the absence of atmosphere and is a standard product from a new generation of gloabl imaging spectro-radiometers.
 - **NIR**: Near infrared spectral region
 - **%N**: Foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (in grams per 100g of dry foliage mass)
 - **PAR**: Photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm)
 - **LAI**: Leaf area index
 - **Leaf albedo** The fraction of radiation incident on the leaf that is reflected or transmitted. This is the only optical variable that conveys information about leaf biochemical constituents, e.g. nitrogen content.
 - **Recollisition probability** The probability that a photon scattered by material in the canopy will interact with matter in the canopy again. If vegetation canopy can be treated as a "big leaf" (no structure, LAI = 1) the recollisition probability is zero because photons reflected from or transmitted through such a leaf wil not encounter another leaf. The recollisition probability depends on canopy geometrical properties at different scales such as the spatial distribution of the trees on the ground, tree crown shape and size, and within-crown foliage arrangement. The higher the probability is, the higher the likelihood of photon absorption and consequently fewer photons exit the vegetation. For the same amount of foliage area, the recollisition probability for coniferous forest is larger compared with that for broadleaf species due to the difference in the small-scale structural organization.
 - **Spatial resolution**: Remotely sensed images are numeric representations of the sampled Earth's surface made up of individual picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel represents a square area on an image that is a measure of the sensor's resolution. The finer the spatial resolution, the smaller the objects that are detectable. The digital values are transmitted to receiving stations and then manipulated by computers for visual displaying.
 - **Spectral resolution**: Most sensors are only able to sample a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectral resolution is used to describe the number of sensor wavebands and associated bandwidths used in sampling the spectrum. High-spectral resolution is achieved with a hi gher number of narrow bandwidths, which collectively provide a representation of the spectral signature of the surface.
 - **Temporal resolution**: This is used to describe frequency of coverage by a sensor over any specific area. It is related to the sensor field of view, pixel size and pointing capabilities. This is important in Earth monitoring studies, change detection and global change studies.
 - **Radiometric resolution**: This is used to describe the fidelity with which a sensor can distinguish reflectance differences. It is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio of a particular sensor.


# Concepts:

 - The architecture of individuals plants, their spatial distribution, and reflectivity to the ground (or understoy) beneath a vegetation canopy also determine the angular patterns of reflected ratiation, or the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF dimensionless)
 - **Reflectance saturation**: A lack of correlation between NIR BRF and proxies of canopy strcuture such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy height, commonly observed in dense vegetation. The surface reflectance reaches an asymptote and thus is insensitive to LAI and/or canopy height. For example, the level of NIR reflectance at which saturation occurs depends on the species because species differ in their structura attributes. That is, the same amount of leaf area can be distributed in many ways to form canopues of varying tpology. The BFR values can be different although the canopy LAI and height are same in all cases. The effects of 3D structure on radiative processes can affect the sensitivity of canopy NIR reflectance to leaf optical properties.
 - **Specular radiation** emanates from light reflected at the air-cuticule interface. This portion of reflected radiation is, in general, but no always, partly polarized and exhibits a weak spectral dependency. *It does not interact with the pigments inside the leaf, but depends on the properties of the leaf surface*,and therefore conveys no information about the constitution of the leaf tissue.
 - **Diffuse radiation** results from interactions within the leaf interior and any large particles on the leaf surface (hair, dust and micro to millimeter-scale wax structures) is not polarized. Its spectral behavior is mainly determined by the intrinsic optical properties of leaf constituents.
 - The spectral band about 650 nm (where chlorohyll absorption is strong), a polarized reflectance of 9% may account for 58% of the total radiation reflected by the leaf. 
 - In the NIR (800 - 850 nm)  where pigments do not absorb anymore, variation between species in the radiation scattered from the leaf interior can be comparable to or smaller than that of the leaf surface reflected radiation.
 - Leaf optical properties cannot be directly measured from space because the radiation scattered from leaves and exiting the canopy in the direction of the sensor is strongly affected by the 3D canopy structure.

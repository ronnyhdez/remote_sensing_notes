Energy resources : - Passive sensors: This ones just measure reflectance. Some examples are NOAA, Sentinel 1. Negative side is that clouds can interfere with the methodology and measurements. - Active sensors: They emit a beam of light and measure houw much returned back. Some examples are Lidar, radarsat. Wavelength region : - Visible / reflectie infrared - Thermal infrared - Microwave Spatial resolution Active and passive sensors have different spatial resolution. Spatial resolution is about how clear can you see the ground,or the object in the image. An important concept is the pure pixel A pure pixel can be a pixel that is composed almost everything by just one component, for example, a pixel that shows just a forest or just an urban area. This pure pixels are the ones that can tell to a computer the main characteristics of the object represented in there.

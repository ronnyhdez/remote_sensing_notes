Describe the surface reflective properties in the absence of atmosphere and is a standard product from a new generation of gloabl imaging spectro-radiometers. NIR : Near infrared spectral region %N : Foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (in grams per 100g of dry foliage mass) PAR : Photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) LAI : Leaf area index Leaf albedo The fraction of radiation incident on the leaf that is reflected or transmitted. This is the only optical variable that conveys information about leaf biochemical constituents, e.g. nitrogen content. Recollisition probability The probability that a photon scattered by material in the canopy will interact with matter in the canopy again. If vegetation canopy can be treated as a \"big leaf\" (no structure, LAI = 1) the recollisition probability is zero because photons reflected from or transmitted through such a leaf wil not encounter another leaf. The recollisition probability depends on canopy geometrical properties at different scales such as the spatial distribution of the trees on the ground, tree crown shape and size, and within-crown foliage arrangement. The higher the probability is, the higher the likelihood of photon absorption and consequently fewer photons exit the vegetation. For the same amount of foliage area, the recollisition probability for coniferous forest is larger compared with that for broadleaf species due to the difference in the small-scale structural organization. Concepts: The architecture of individuals plants, their spatial distribution, and reflectivity to the ground (or understoy) beneath a vegetation canopy also determine the angular patterns of reflected ratiation, or the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF dimensionless) Reflectance saturation : A lack of correlation between NIR BRF and proxies of canopy strcuture such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy height, commonly observed in dense vegetation. The surface reflectance reaches an asymptote and thus is insensitive to LAI and/or canopy height. For example, the level of NIR reflectance at which saturation occurs depends on the species because species differ in their structura attributes. That is, the same amount of leaf area can be distributed in many ways to form canopues of varying tpology. The BFR values can be different although the canopy LAI and height are same in all cases. The effects of 3D structure on radiative processes can affect the sensitivity of canopy NIR reflectance to leaf optical properties. Specular radiation emanates from light reflected at the air-cuticule interface. This portion of reflected radiation is, in general, but no always, partly polarized and exhibits a weak spectral dependency. It does not interact with the pigments inside the leaf, but depends on the properties of the leaf surface ,and therefore conveys no information about the constitution of the leaf tissue. Diffuse radiation results from interactions within the leaf interior and any large particles on the leaf surface (hair, dust and micro to millimeter-scale wax structures) is not polarized. Its spectral behavior is mainly determined by the intrinsic optical properties of leaf constituents. The spectral band about 650 nm (where chlorohyll absorption is strong), a polarized reflectance of 9% may account for 58% of the total radiation reflected by the leaf. In the NIR (800 - 850 nm) where pigments do not absorb anymore, variation between species in the radiation scattered from the leaf interior can be comparable to or smaller than that of the leaf surface reflected radiation. Leaf optical properties cannot be directly measured from space because the radiation scattered from leaves and exiting the canopy in the direction of the sensor is strongly affected by the 3D canopy structure.","title":"Keywords in remote sensing"},{"location":"concepts/#keywords-in-remote-sensing","text":"BRF : Vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor.

Energy resources : - Passive sensors: This ones just measure reflectance. Some examples are NOAA, Sentinel 1. Negative side is that clouds can interfere with the methodology and measurements. - Active sensors: They emit a beam of light and measure houw much returned back. Some examples are Lidar, radarsat. Wavelength region : - Visible / reflectie infrared - Thermal infrared - Microwave Spatial resolution Active and passive sensors have different spatial resolution. Spatial resolution is about how clear can you see the ground,or the object in the image. An important concept is the pure pixel A pure pixel can be a pixel that is composed almost everything by just one component, for example, a pixel that shows just a forest or just an urban area. This pure pixels are the ones that can tell to a computer the main characteristics of the object represented in there. There is a phenomena that occurs with the pixel classification. This is because, given that the pure pixel can be a little bit combined (its classified as a forest but it has a small portion of urban area) we are going to have some bias in the classification. Although this approximation to the problem works. Nonetheles, there are other methodologies to create better classifications such as pixel breakdown . Temporal resolution This is the amount of pictures in time that we can obtain from a certain place. The need for a bigger or a smaller scale of temporal resolution it's going to depend on the study. For example, agricultural landscapes will need a bigger temporal resolution (be able to detect changes in short periods of time) given that the changes in the landscape over time are very common. On the other side, geological studies commonly don't need to have a detailed temporal resolution becauses changes are not that common.

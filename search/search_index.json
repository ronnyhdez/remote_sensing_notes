If vegetation canopy can be treated as a \"big leaf\" (no structure, LAI = 1) the recollisition probability is zero because photons reflected from or transmitted through such a leaf wil not encounter another leaf. The recollisition probability depends on canopy geometrical properties at different scales such as the spatial distribution of the trees on the ground, tree crown shape and size, and within-crown foliage arrangement. The higher the probability is, the higher the likelihood of photon absorption and consequently fewer photons exit the vegetation. For the same amount of foliage area, the recollisition probability for coniferous forest is larger compared with that for broadleaf species due to the difference in the small-scale structural organization. Spatial resolution : Remotely sensed images are numeric representations of the sampled Earth's surface made up of individual picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel represents a square area on an image that is a measure of the sensor's resolution. The finer the spatial resolution, the smaller the objects that are detectable. The digital values are transmitted to receiving stations and then manipulated by computers for visual displaying. Spectral resolution : Most sensors are only able to sample a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectral resolution is used to describe the number of sensor wavebands and associated bandwidths used in sampling the spectrum. High-spectral resolution is achieved with a hi gher number of narrow bandwidths, which collectively provide a representation of the spectral signature of the surface. Temporal resolution : This is used to describe frequency of coverage by a sensor over any specific area. It is related to the sensor field of view, pixel size and pointing capabilities. This is important in Earth monitoring studies, change detection and global change studies. Radiometric resolution : This is used to describe the fidelity with which a sensor can distinguish reflectance differences. It is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio of a particular sensor. SIF : Sun-induced chlorophyll flourescence is an electromagnetic signal emitted by chlorophyll a molecules when exposed to sunlight. Is a very weak signal compared to reflected sunlight as only a few percent of the absorbed energy is re-emitted as SIF.

Concepts: The architecture of individuals plants, their spatial distribution, and reflectivity to the ground (or understoy) beneath a vegetation canopy also determine the angular patterns of reflected ratiation, or the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF dimensionless) Reflectance saturation : A lack of correlation between NIR BRF and proxies of canopy strcuture such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy height, commonly observed in dense vegetation. The surface reflectance reaches an asymptote and thus is insensitive to LAI and/or canopy height. For example, the level of NIR reflectance at which saturation occurs depends on the species because species differ in their structura attributes. That is, the same amount of leaf area can be distributed in many ways to form canopues of varying tpology. The BFR values can be different although the canopy LAI and height are same in all cases. The effects of 3D structure on radiative processes can affect the sensitivity of canopy NIR reflectance to leaf optical properties. Specular radiation emanates from light reflected at the air-cuticule interface. This portion of reflected radiation is, in general, but no always, partly polarized and exhibits a weak spectral dependency. It does not interact with the pigments inside the leaf, but depends on the properties of the leaf surface ,and therefore conveys no information about the constitution of the leaf tissue. Diffuse radiation results from interactions within the leaf interior and any large particles on the leaf surface (hair, dust and micro to millimeter-scale wax structures) is not polarized. Its spectral behavior is mainly determined by the intrinsic optical properties of leaf constituents. The spectral band about 650 nm (where chlorohyll absorption is strong), a polarized reflectance of 9% may account for 58% of the total radiation reflected by the leaf. In the NIR (800 - 850 nm) where pigments do not absorb anymore, variation between species in the radiation scattered from the leaf interior can be comparable to or smaller than that of the leaf surface reflected radiation. Leaf optical properties cannot be directly measured from space because the radiation scattered from leaves and exiting the canopy in the direction of the sensor is strongly affected by the 3D canopy structure. Applications of SIF are diverse and includes photosynthetic phenology, plant stress detection and crop yield estimatio, but the main goal of most SIF research is the remote estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity. The canopy-level SIF is controlled by 3 main mechanistic factos as APAR (abosorbed photosynthetically active radiation), chlorophyll fluosrescence emission yield (\u03a6 F) and in the far-red SIF (about 760 nm) scattering of emitted fluorescence within the canopy that allows only a fraction of the emitted radiation to escape the canopy.

Energy resources : Passive sensors: This ones just measure reflectance. Some examples are NOAA, Sentinel 1. Negative side is that clouds can interfere with the methodology and measurements. Active sensors: They emit a beam of light and measure houw much returned back. Some examples are Lidar, radarsat. Wavelength region : Visible / reflectie infrared Thermal infrared Microwave Spatial resolution Active and passive sensors have different spatial resolution. Spatial resolution is about how clear can you see the ground,or the object in the image. An important concept is the pure pixel A pure pixel can be a pixel that is composed almost everything by just one component, for example, a pixel that shows just a forest or just an urban area. This pure pixels are the ones that can tell to a computer the main characteristics of the object represented in there. There is a phenomena that occurs with the pixel classification. This is because, given that the pure pixel can be a little bit combined (its classified as a forest but it has a small portion of urban area) we are going to have some bias in the classification. Although this approximation to the problem works. Nonetheles, there are other methodologies to create better classifications such as pixel breakdown . Temporal resolution This is the amount of pictures in time that we can obtain from a certain place. The need for a bigger or a smaller scale of temporal resolution it's going to depend on the study. For example, agricultural landscapes will need a bigger temporal resolution (be able to detect changes in short periods of time) given that the changes in the landscape over time are very common. On the other side, geological studies commonly don't need to have a detailed temporal resolution becauses changes are not that common. On slide 7 in Lecture 1 there is graphic showing the relation between spatial and temporal resolution. Radiometric resolution This is the sensitivity of a sensor, i.e. it's ability to measure and to enable distinction from the same spectral band of differences in the electromagnetic energy reflected by the elementary ground surfaces. For example, if we have an image with just 4 grey levels, the ability to distinguish between the objects in the surface is not much, but if the same image has 256 grey levels, objects in surface are better defined. Spectral resolution The spectral response which characterize the reflectance and/or emittance of a feature or target over a variety of wavelengths allows to distinguish between different classes or features and details in an image. The ability of a sensor to define fine wavelengths intervals is the spectral resolution. Different sensors have different abilities to define the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This electromagnetic spectrum have known segments as for example the visible spectrum that goes from 400 to 700 nm in wavelength (0.4 um - 0.7 u). The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers from from 1mm to 750 nm and can be divided in 3 parts: Near infrared 2500 - 750 nm Mid-infrared 10 - 2.5 um Far infrared 1mm - 10 um During Lecture 2, we received the following electromagnetic spectrum classification: Visible 0.4 - 0.7 nm Reflective infrared 0.7 - 3.0 nm Thermal infrared 3 - 14 nm On slide 10 in Lecture 1 there is an image of the electromagnetic spectrum. We can see that more wavelength less frequency. Spectral reflectance The spectral reflectance results from the presence or absence, as well as the position and shape of specific absorption features of the surface. With the sprectral reflectance, we can obtain the spectral signature of different elements in a surface, for example, soil, vegetation, minerals among others. When we have a figure with spectral signatures, we need to understand that when in the y-axis (reflectance) there is a decrease in the curve, its because of the aborbance of radiation. High points in the curve means that there is no absorption of radiation. Different elements will have different signatures and thats, in general terms, we can have an idea of the composition of the elements in a surface. Another phenomena occurs when there is presence of water, given that this element have low levels (almost al the curve near 0) in the infreared spectrum. The spectral scale goes from 0 to 1. 0 means black and 1 white Multispectral Remote sensing systems can record energy over separate wavelength ranges at various spectral resolutionsThis is over a variety of different wavelength ranges. Usually they scan 7 bands. Hyperspectral Systems that are more advance than multispectral ones, can record more that 7 bands . So this systems have the capacity to detect hundreds of very narrow spectral bands throughout the visible, near-infrared and mid-infreared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Platforms: Satellite characteristics There are two types of satellites according to it's orbits: High level : ~36 000 km and geonsynchronous orbits (horizontal) Low earth orbit : less than 1500 km and sunsynchronous orbits (vertical) Passive sensing Solar radiation is either reflected (VIS/NIR) or absorbed the reemitted (thermal IR) One of the downsides of this methodology is that the presence of clouds in the image can interfere with the measurements. When there are clouds, the term diffuse light is used. When there are no clouds and the image is clear, the term direct light is used. Problem with clouds is just not the space the occupy in the image (a loss of information in areas covered by clouds) but also the shadow they generate. In order to consider a quality image, this one needs to have less than 20% of cloud coverage. When this is happening, i.e. a 20% of cloud coverage in the image represents a loss of information of more than 20% because there will be shadows. Active sensing The sensor platform is the energy source as well as the measurement device. This methodology does not works well when there is presence of water, i.e. wetlands or lakes. This is because water aborbs the radiation. Infrared radtion is aboserbed by water Sensors examples Low resolution : NOAA-AVHRR Medium resolution : TERRA-MODIS High resolution : Lansat, SPOT, Sentinel Very high resolution : Iknos2, Quickbird2, Worldview2 From slide 21 to slide 30 in lecture 1 there is a description of each of the sentinel satellites launched by ESA. Plants Spectral properties in plants Three leaf components intercept most of the radiation: Pigments Leaf structure Water content Reflectance and plants On plant's spectral signatures we can see that there is peak around 550, that it's known as green peak Around the 1400 values, curves tend to have low reflectance values which is due to the presence of water. If wee see the inverse tendency (high reflectance values) it's because leaves can be dry. So, there is a relation between the reflectance and the physiological state of plants. Reflectance + Transmission = 1 If there is a body of water that appears to have absorption on the 0.4 - 0.7 um its probably due to the presence of algae. If the soil is too dry, reflectance will be really high, and almost all reflectance will be due to the presence of minerals. When exploring reflectance plots we noted some curves with a lot of noise, this may be caused by the sensor inhability to measure of those wavelength bands. Leaf spectral signatures The optical leaf profiles depend on foliar pigment type and content, as well as anatomical aspects and cellular structure. This is why we can obtain different spectral signatures from different plant species. Phenology Given that plants have more than pigment that aborbs light for photosynthesizing, the phenology of the plant in a given moment will have an impact on it's spectral reflectance. The health or senescence sequence of a leaf can be deduced from its spectral characteristics. Vegetation indexes A vegetation index is a single number that quantifies vegetation biomass and/or plant vigor for each pixel in a remote sensing image. Every inedx is basically a certain combination (formula) of the sensor-measured reflectance properties, i.e. water content, chlorophyll content, pigment among others. An example of this indexes is the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) ranges from +1.0 to -1.0. Areas withoud vegetation as bare rocks, sand or snow show very low NDVI values (from 0.1 or less). Sparse vegetation such as shrubs, grasslands or senescing crops show moderate NDVI values (from 0.2 to 0.5) Dense vegetation found in tropical and temperate forest shows high NDVI values (from 0.6 to 0.9) Another example is how healthy or stressed the vegetation is and the NDVI values. A healthy plant could have an NDVI value of .72 and the reflectance will be composed by 50% NIR and 8% RED A stressed plant could show and NDVI of 0.14 and the reflectance will be composed by 40% NIR and 30% RED. Stressed plant will have a bigger composition of its reflectance from RED and lower representation of the NIR.
